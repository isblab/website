# Join us!

<p class="text-justify">
We welcome highly motivated students who are excited to work in integrative structural biology. Students in the group work on a spectrum of projects from computational method development to modeling specific assemblies to performing cell biology/biochemistry experiments. <br><br>

One focus of ours is to combine protein structural modeling with cell biology and biophysics/biochemistry experiments (mass spectrometry/cryo-electron microscopy/tomography) in close collaborations with labs on campus and elsewhere. Students focus on modeling specific assemblies and they may choose to do some of these experiments themselves, in the labs of collaborators. <br><br>

In keeping with the recent advances in structural biology, another focus of ours is to develop computational methods for inferring protein organisation in the cell using statistical inference, and specifically, machine learning and deep learning. We're actively looking for deep-learning enthusiasts to join us! <br><br>

</p>

<p class="text-justify">
The lab is an interdisciplinary environment and has had students from biology (biochemistry, biotech, microbiology), medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, and engineering backgrounds. Folks who'd like to cross-train (e.g., biologists who are curious about programming, or computer scientists who'd like to develop tools for biology) are most welcome. Â <br><br>

</p>

<p class="text-justify">
Students who join the lab must be interested to do computer programming and are required to have a significant computational component to their thesis. Prior programming background is helpful, but an analytical bent of mind, curiosity, and initiative are more important. There are opportunities for PhD students on campus to do both computational modeling and cell biology/structural biology experiments. <br><br>

## PhD and MSc thesis positions

 Currently, we have the following open positions. Please email your CV and a short (2-3 paragraphs) research proposal on the projects you are interested in working on.

- *PhD student*:  If you are interested in doing a PhD in the lab, please get in touch. There are several routes to becoming a PhD student in the lab.

   * PhD students usually come in via the <a href='https://www.ncbs.res.in/academic/admissions'>NCBS admissions</a> process. <br>
   * If you have a Physics/Engineering/CS background and are interested in Biology, be sure to check out the new TIFR Interdisciplinary PhD program (link coming up). <br>
   * Students with national fellowships (CSIR-NET, GATE, and others) can also register for a PhD in the lab. <br><br>

- *Masters thesis student* (structural biology, computation): Must be willing to commit a minimum of one year in the lab and have prior programming experience.<br><br>

## JRF, Project Assistant, and intern positions

We have a Project Assistant position in computational biology available! Please see details <a href='https://www.ncbs.res.in/jobportal/node/63414'>here</a>.
