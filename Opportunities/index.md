## Join us!

<p class="text-justify">
We welcome highly motivated students who are excited to work in integrative structural biology. Students in the group work on a spectrum of projects from computational method development to modeling specific assemblies. <br><br>

One focus of the group is to develop computational methods for inferring protein organization in the cell. We’re inspired by algorithms from statistical inference and optimization, including machine learning and deep learning,  computer vision, and graph theory.  We’re actively looking for deep-learning enthusiasts to join us! <br><br>

Another focus is to combine protein structural modeling with data from cell biology and biophysics/biochemistry experiments (mass spectrometry/cryo-electron microscopy/tomography) in close collaborations with experimental labs on campus and elsewhere. Students focus on modeling specific assemblies and deducing the functions of these assemblies in light of their structure. <br><br>

</p>

<p class="text-justify">
The lab is an interdisciplinary environment and has had students from biology (biochemistry, biotech, microbiology), medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, and engineering backgrounds. Folks who'd like to cross-train (e.g., biologists who are curious about programming, or computer scientists who'd like to develop tools for biology) are most welcome.  <br><br>

</p>

<p class="text-justify">
Students who join the lab must be interested to do computer programming. They usually develop novel computational methods in addition to modeling specific biological systems. Prior programming background is helpful, but an analytical bent of mind, curiosity, and initiative are more important.<br><br>

### PhD student positions

If you are interested in doing a PhD in the lab, please get in touch. There are several routes to becoming a PhD student in the lab.

   * PhD students usually come in via the <a href='https://www.ncbs.res.in/academic/admissions'>NCBS admissions</a> process. <br>
   * If you have a Physics/Engineering/CS background and are interested in doing Biology research, check out the new <a href='https://pol.ncbs.res.in'> TIFR-PoL Interdisciplinary PhD program</a>. <br>
   * Students with national fellowships (CSIR-NET, GATE, and others) are welcome to email directly. <br><br>

### Postdoc positions
We have one open position. To apply, please email your CV and a statement of interest on the projects you’d like to work on.<br><br>

### Masters thesis, JRF, Project Assistant, Intern positions
