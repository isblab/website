## ISB Lab Software and Resources

### Software

Check out software developed by our group and other open-source freebies at [ISB Lab GitHub](https://github.com/isblab). <br>


#### IMP-related software

Many of the packages we develop are integrated with the Integrative modeling Platform [IMP](https://integrativemodeling.org/), which we use to model protein assemblies. <br>

- [**NestOR**](https://github.com/isblab/nestor) : Nested sampling-based optimization of representation for integrative structural modeling. <br><br>

- [**PrISM**](https://github.com/isblab/prism) : Package to annotate high- and low-precision regions in integrative structure models. Now used by wwPDB to validate integrative models! <br><br>

- [**StOP**](https://github.com/isblab/stop) : Stochastic Optimization of Parameters (StOP) automates the tuning of MCMC parameters for stochastic sampling in IMP.
	-  Check this tutorial for optimizing Monte Carlo [move sizes/restraint weights](https://github.com/isblab/stop/blob/main/docs/tutorial_basic.md).
	-  And this one for optimizing [replica exchange temperatures](https://github.com/isblab/stop/blob/main/docs/tutorial_replica.md). <br><br>

- [**Sampcon**](https://github.com/salilab/imp-sampcon) : Pipeline for analysing integrative models after MCMC sampling. Includes tests for assessing sampling exhaustiveness, clustering models, and calculating precision. <br>


#### Protein-protein docking-related software

- [**Scoring functions**](https://github.com/isblab/dockingScripts/tree/main/capriScripts/potentials): PISA (atomic), PIE (residue), and C3 (combination) scoring functions for ranking models of protein-protein complexes produced by docking programs.   

- [**Other utilities**](https://github.com/isblab/dockingScripts): Contains scripts for calculating interface RMSD, and other utilities for modifying PDBs, adding chain names, running Modeller etc.  <br>


### Courses and workshops

#### Integrative modeling tutorials and workshops

#### Graduate courses at NCBS 

- [Statistical Inference in Biology](http://moodle.ncbs.res.in/course/view.php?id=107) (internal link) co-taught with Dr Shaon Chakrabarti at NCBS.  <br>

- Crash course in [Python](https://github.com/isblab/pycrash) taught during the Statistical Inference course.  <br>
